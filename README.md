## WordBot
A discord word bot guessing game inspired by Wordle

WordBot is a guessing game...But with words. This bot uses all the words in the English Dictionary to make a guessing game with words inspired by Wordle. This bot uses an open-source words_dictionary.json(https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_dictionary.json) file from Github(https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)

NOTE: This project only the words_dictionary.json(https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_dictionary.json) for simplicity. However, it may be expanded to the full words.txt file
